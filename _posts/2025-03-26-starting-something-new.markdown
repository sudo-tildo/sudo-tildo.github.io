I'm starting this blog to help me stay on track with my schedule. It will serve as a daily reminder that I need to improveâ€”not because I want to get hired or fit into some company culture as a "role model" developer. Not even close. I do it simply because I genuinely enjoy programming and seeing good results. And as a natural consequence, that will make me a strong candidate for any position.

This quote perfectly captures what I mean about becoming better.

I find it incredibly fun that a developer can create tools to solve their own problems or help others with theirs.

Sorry if this article comes across as too romanticized or delusional--like one of those typical LinkedIn posts you see every day. But this is truly how I feel about software development. Okay, maybe not all of it. Writing CRUD apps and other "professional" software can be painfully boring. What I'm really talking about when I say "programming" is creating games and apps that I personally find useful, interesting, or just fun.

To sum it up, this blog isn't just for you--it's for me too. I want to get better purely for the fun of it. Don't expect me to post here to impress recruiters. Expect me to post because I find something interesting, or cool.

Thank you for reading this, you know where to find me. See ya! ðŸ‘‹
