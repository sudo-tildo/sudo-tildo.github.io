## What is it?

This is one of the first "real projects" I worked on while learning how to program.  

I created this game as part of a selection process, where I was challenged to implement new features and style it to my liking (which includes the power-ups and Metal Slug's art). I used Pygame for development, and it was my first time applying concepts like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in practice. I'm very proud of this project because I "finished" it in just 15 days and then never touched it again.

## Stack Used
