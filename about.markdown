Hello, everyone! My name is Breno. I'm a sophomore in Software Engineering, and this website will serve as my personal blog (web corner) and portfolio.

I thought it would be a good idea to have this space so anyone can keep up with my projects, experiences, struggles, and more.

## How did I get started with programming?

My passion for software development started when I was just a kid playing a lot of video games. That time in my life surely ignited a flame in my soul to pursue this as my career.

However, my real interest began during my Minecraft and Flash (Rest In Peace) games phase. Back then, I enjoyed playing but became really interested in how they worked and how to make one myself. So, I tried learning Flash and was even able to make a Pong! clone. But as a kid, I didn't have the maturity to keep at it, and one day, my computer stopped working--after that, I completely stopped programming.

## Hobbies

Even though I spend most of my day in front of my PC, I have other hobbies, such as reading, watching movies, and working out (I go to the gym, run, and also practice Judo).

- Gaming is my biggest hobby. I love *The Last of Us*, *Resident Evil*, *Black Ops 2*, and *Street Fighter 3rd Strike*.
- I'm a huge fan of comics: *Akira*, *Watchmen*, *Slam Dunk*, and *Batman: Year One* are some of my favorites.
- My favorite movies are *Spider-Man 2* (Sam Raimi), *The Good, the Bad and the Ugly*, and *Rocky*.
